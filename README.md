# Pseudo-Physics-Informed Neural Operators: Enhancing Operator Learning from Limited Data

This repository contains the official implementation codes of **Pseudo-Physics-Informed Neural Operators: Enhancing Operator Learning from Limited Data**.

## Datasets
The data can be downloaded from [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sTAz7rjgeQGhmt6bboUwGpTyQIYCm1jS?usp=sharing).

## Quick Start: run experiments
Download the data in the sample folder with codes. Each script file can be run by "python 'file_name'".

## Example: run one script

For example, to run the Darcy-Flow experiment (128 resolution):

```bash
python darcy_128_fno_reformat_co.py
